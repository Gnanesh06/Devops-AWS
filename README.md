# Devops-AWS
This is my first experiment on AWS,Creation of IAM (Identity and Access Management)  User and User Groups (Admin User).
To create user groups and groups, first we need to login to the aws management console as a root user.
A root user can create an IAM user but an IAM user cannot create another IAM user.
This means that an IAM user uses the credentials of root user to login aws console.
After login to the console, we can create user group and users.
